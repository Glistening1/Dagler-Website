        <h4>Course Overview</h4>
        <p>Welcome to AP Computer Science Principles.
           Here you will find all the handouts you will need.
           This course is designed to be equivalent to a first-semester introductory college computing course.
           In this course, students will develop computational thinking skills vital for success across all disciplines, such as using computational tools to analyze and study data and working with large datasets to analyze, visualize, and draw conclusions from trends.
           The course engages students in the creative aspects of the field by allowing them to develop computational artifacts based on their interests.
           Students will also develop effective communication and collaboration skills by working individually and collaboratively to solve problems and will discuss and write about the impacts these solutions could have on their community, society, and the world.</p>
        <br>
        <h4>Class Policies</h4>
        <p>All school and district rules/policies are expected and enforced. The two most important rules to me are:
        you are respectful to yourself and others, and you are engaged and learning the material we are working on in the class.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h4>Grading Policies</h4>
        <p>Grades are based on the percent of total points earned from assignments, activities, and projects. Points are cumulative for each term.
        Here is the grading scale for out class:

        <p>Students are expected to complete and submit their own work. Involvement in any activity for the purpose of copying,
        cheating or benefiting from work that is not 100% their own will be subject to consequences as outlined in the Academic
        Code of Condunct.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h4>Privilege Passes</h4>
        <p>Students will be issued 3 privilege passes to be used, with teacher approval, whenever they leave the classroom during class.
        Unused passes may be redeemed for extra credit at the end of the term. Students should have their passes with them daily.</p>
