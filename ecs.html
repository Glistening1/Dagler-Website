           <h4>Course Overview:</h4>
           <p>Exploring Computer Science is a high school introduction to the world of computer scienc and problem solving.
             The three strains interwoven throughout this course are computer science concepts, inquiry, and equity.
             The six central units are Human Computer Interaction, Problem Solving, Web Design, Command Line Interface, Programming, and Robotics.

           <h4>Text Book: </h4>
           <p><i>None</i></p>

           <h4>Prerequisites: </h4>
           <p><i>None</i></p>

           <h4>Required Class Materials: </h4>
           <p> Sharpened Pencil and Pen.</p>

           <h4> Class Policies: </h4>
           <p>All school and district rules/policies are expected and enforced.
              The two most importatn rules to me are: you are respectful to yourself and others, and you are engaged and learning the material we are working on in the class.</p>

           <h4>Grading Policies: </h4>
           <p>Grades are based on the percent of total points earned from assignments, activities and projects.
              Points are cumulative for each term. Here is the grading scale for our class: </p>

           <table class="table">
             <tr>
               <td>
           <p>A (90%-100%): A student who is excellent in computer science and an outstanding student. </p>
           <p>B (80%-89.9%): A student who is excellent in computer science and an average student, or average in computer scienc and a great student. </p>
           <p>C (70%-79.9%): A student who is average in computer science and an average student, or excellent in computer science and a poor student. </p>
           <p>D/F (0%-69.9%): A student who needs to retake the course because of poor study skills and lack of effort. </p>

           </table>

           <p>Students are expected to complete and submit their own work.
              Involvement in any activity for the purpose of copying, cheating or benefiting from work that is not 100% their own will be subject to consequences as outlined in the Academic Code of Conduct. </p>

            <h4>Privilege Passes</h4>
            <p>Students will be issued 3 privilege passes to be used, with teacher approval, whenever they leave the classroom during class.
               Unused passes may be redeemed for extra credit at the end of the term.
               Students should have their passes with them daily. </p>

            <p><b>Preparation</b> - Be ready physically and mentally. </p>
            <p><b>Respect</b> - Show consideration, appreciation, and acceptance.</p>
            <p><b>Integrity</b> - Be honest, sincere, and in words and actions.</p>
            <p><b>Determination</b> - Set goals and meet expectations. </p>
            <p><b>Empathy</b> - Show the ability to understand and share the feelings of another.</p>

            <h4>The Computer Science Pathway: </h4>
            <p>This course is part of a three-year computer science pathway.
               The courses in order are Exploring Computer Science, AP Computer Science Principles and AP Computer Science A.
               Each of these courses is a prerequisite of the one before it. </p>
